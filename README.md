## A bit about me ðŸ˜„
My name is Sergio and I am a PhD student at Imperial. I am currently working on GNAR time series models for macroeconomic forecasting, in the larger context of statistics and ML for public policy. Before this, I studied maths at Warwick and went on to do part III at Cambridge, after which I did a very much needed gap year. Outside of uni, I like to cook, go bouldering, reading and dancing salsa! 

## UNED Economics Lecture Notes
Here is a collection of lecture notes crafted by me for the Economics degree offered by UNED. They will most likely include typos and I claim no orginality! Some extracts might be taken for the recommended bibliography. I hope this is useful to fellow students!
### Primero de Carrera

### Segundo de Carrera

### Tercero de Carrera
