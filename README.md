## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## My name is Sergio and I am a PhD student at Imperial. I am currently working on GNAR time series models for macroeconomic forecasting, in the larger context of statistics and ML for public policy. Before this, I studied maths at Warwick and went on to do part III at Cambridge, after which I did a very much needed gap year. Outside of uni, I like to cook, go bouldering, reading and dancing salsa!
